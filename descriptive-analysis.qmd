## Introduction

This document presents the results from 4 different tools that screen papers for one or more registration IDs (protocol, trial registry, etc). Overall, 200 IDs found in 117 papers were analyzed.

#### Main analyses: 

1.  Types of ID detected

2.  Where were the IDs located (abstract section, methods section, etc.)?

3.  Were the papers research articles?

4.  Did the tools agree? (i.e. they all found the ID).

5.  Additional observations

## 1) Types of ID detected

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

install.packages("readr")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("here")

```

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(here)

#load dataset
data <- read_csv(here("testing", "regset.csv"))

#general overview
table(data$id_type_group)
```

The three main groups of ID observed were `trial registration numbers (trn)`, `protocols`, and `false positives`.

### TRNs

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

trn <- subset(data, data$id_type %in% c("ctgov", "umin", "drks", "irct", "chictr", "isrctn","ctri", "eudract", "actrn", "jrct", "kct", "ntr", "pactr"))

table(trn$id_type)
```

The majority of the trial registry numbers were from the ctgov registry, followed umin, dkrs and irct.

**note on the names**:

-   ctgov - US Clinical Trials Register

-   umin - University Hospital Medical Information Network Register

-   drks - German Clinical Trials Register

-   irct - Iranian Registry of Cinical Trials

-   chictr - Chinese Clinical Trial Registry

-   isrctn - ISRCTN Registry

-   ctri - Clinical Trials Registry-India

-   eudract - EU Clinical Trials Register

-   actrn - Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry

-   jrct - Japan Registry of Clinical Trials

-   kct - Korean Clinical Trial Registry

-   ntr - Dutch Trial Register

-   pactr - Pan African Clinical Trials Registry

### Protocols

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

protocol <- subset(data, data$id_type %in% c("protocols_io"))

table(protocol$id_type)
```

We only had two IDs that were included in links to specific protocols from protocols.io

### False positives

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

false_positive <- subset(data, data$id_type %in% c("catalogue_id", "datapoint", "drug_id", "funding_id", "medical_acronym", "medical_device"))

table(false_positive$id_type)
```

The main types of false positives we encounter were IDs corresponding to specific fundings or grants.

## 2) Where were the IDs located?
