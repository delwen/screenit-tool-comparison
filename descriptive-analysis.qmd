## Introduction

This document presents the descriptive results from the analysis of 4 different tools (`sciscore`, `trialidentifier`, `ctregistries` and `nct`). The aim of these tools is to screen papers for one or more registration IDs (protocol, trial registry, etc).

#### Data description

This analysis was limited to papers (n = 117) where a hit was found by one or more tools. Overall, 200 IDs were analyzed. These IDs were grouped in a data file named `regset.csv`, with the following variables/columns:

-   **Identifier**: character. It contains the ID detected. Example: `NCT03192410`.

-   **PMCID**: character. PMC identifier of the paper where the ID was found.

-   **sciscore_hit:** boolean. It is `TRUE` if the tool **sciscore** detected the identifier. Otherwise `FALSE`.

-   **trialidentifier_hit:** boolean. It is `TRUE` if the tool **trialidentifier** detected the identifier. Otherwise `FALSE`.

-   **ctregistries_hit:** boolean. It is `TRUE` if the tool **ctregistries** detected the identifier. Otherwise `FALSE`.

-   **nct_hit**: boolean. It is `TRUE` if the tool **nct** detected the identifier. Otherwise `FALSE`.

-   **paper_url**: link to the PubMed website where the paper is available.

-   **id_type_group**: character. Broad registration category for the detected identifier. For example, if the id is a trial registration identifier number, then the category is `trn`.

-   **id_type**: character. Specific type of identifier found. For example, if the id is grouped as a trn, then the id type consists of the initials of the registry where it comes from, such as `ctgov`.

-   **id_in_abstract**: boolean. It is `TRUE` if the identifier is present in abstract, otherwise it is `FALSE`.

-   **id_in_methods**: boolean. It is `TRUE` if the identifier is present in methods, otherwise it is `FALSE`.

-   **id_in_other_location**: boolean. It is `TRUE` if the identifier is present in another location besides from abstract and methods, otherwise it is `FALSE`.

-   **other_location**: character. If *id_in_other_location* was `TRUE`, then the section(s) where the identifier was found in was written in lowercase, and if present in more than one section, it was separated with a comma.

-   **paper_is_research_article**: boolean. It is `TRUE` if the paper is a primary research article with the typical sections of a paper (abstract, introduction, methods, etc.). Otherwise `FALSE` (e.g., protocol paper, review, etc.)

#### Main analyses conducted:

1.  Types of ID detected

2.  Where were the IDs located (abstract section, methods section, etc.)?

3.  Were the papers research articles?

4.  Did the tools agree/disagree? (i.e. they all found the ID = agree).

5.  Description of each tool - type of ID and location

6.  False positives overview

7.  Additional observations

## 1) Types of ID detected

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(here)
library(wordcloud)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

#load dataset
data <- read_csv(here("data", "regset.csv"))

#general overview
data %>%
  count(id_type_group) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  kable()
```

The three main groups of ID observed were `trial registration numbers (trn)`, `false positives` and `protocols`.

### TRNs

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

data %>%
  filter(id_type_group == "trn") %>%
  count(id_type) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  kable()
```

The majority of the trial registry numbers were from the ctgov registry, followed by umin, dkrs and irct.

**note on the names**:

-   ctgov - US Clinical Trials Register

-   umin - University Hospital Medical Information Network Register

-   drks - German Clinical Trials Register

-   irct - Iranian Registry of Cinical Trials

-   chictr - Chinese Clinical Trial Registry

-   isrctn - ISRCTN Registry

-   ctri - Clinical Trials Registry-India

-   eudract - EU Clinical Trials Register

-   actrn - Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry

-   jrct - Japan Registry of Clinical Trials

-   kct - Korean Clinical Trial Registry

-   ntr - Dutch Trial Register

-   pactr - Pan African Clinical Trials Registry

### Protocols

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

data %>%
  filter(id_type_group == "protocol") %>%
  count(id_type_group) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  kable()
```

We only had two IDs that were included in links to specific protocols from protocols.io

![](images/Picture%201.png){width="512"}

### False positives

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

data %>%
  filter(id_type_group == "false_positive") %>%
  count(id_type) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  kable()
```

The main types of false positives we encounter were IDs corresponding to specific fundings or grants.

## 2) Where were the IDs located?

### General overview

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Select only the three columns of interest
location <- data[, c("id_in_abstract", "id_in_methods", "id_in_other_location")]

# Count TRUE values for each selected variable
count_true <- colSums(location)

#select custom colors
custom_palette <- colorRampPalette(c("#4EA8DE", "#48BFE3", "#56CFE1"))

#create barplot
barplot(count_true, names.arg = colnames(location), 
        col = custom_palette(length(count_true)),
        main = "Location of IDs",
        ylab = "Count", ylim = c(0, max(count_true) + 15))

# Calculate the midpoints of the bars
bar_midpoints <- barplot(count_true, plot = FALSE)

# Add total count labels on each column (centered)
text(bar_midpoints, count_true, labels = count_true, pos = 3, col = "black", cex = 0.8)
```

**What were the other locations?** - discussion (53 cases), introduction (23 cases), acknowledgements (16 cases ), results (11 cases), etc.

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# separating locations where there are more than 1 options
locations <- unlist(strsplit(as.character(data$other_location), ", "))

# Create a data frame with the table of frequencies
other_location <- as.data.frame(table(locations))

wordcloud(words = other_location$locations, 
          freq = other_location$Freq,
          min.freq = 0,
          max.words = 200,
          random.order = FALSE,
          rot.per = 0,
          colors = brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))
```

### NOTE:

The IDs analyzed could be in **one or more locations**, that is why there are more cases out of a total of 200 IDs. This is important to remember for a following section that analyzes the location of the ID by tool.

## 3) Were the papers research articles?

Here we evaluated if the papers had the structure of a research article (abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, etc.).

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Calculating number of papers that were research articles
#Group data by PMCID
data %>%
  group_by(PMCID) %>%
  summarise(paper_is_research_article = any(paper_is_research_article)) %>%
  count(paper_is_research_article) %>%
  arrange(desc(paper_is_research_article)) %>%
  kable()
```

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Calculating number of IDs coming from papers that were research articles.
data %>%
  count(paper_is_research_article) %>%
  arrange(desc(paper_is_research_article)) %>%
  kable()
```

Out of 117 papers reviewed, 112 were research articles, and were associated with 159 IDs. The remaining 5 articles in which 41 IDs were found appeared to be either protocol papers, review of findings and an article that did not present a methods section.

It is important to note that 33 out of the 41 IDs came from the same non-research article, which conducted a review and cited studies using their ctgov ID ([click here to see article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35237397/))

## 4) Did the tools agree/disagree?

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

data %>%
  count(tools_agree) %>%
  arrange(desc(tools_agree)) %>%
  kable()
```

Overall, the tools agreed in 54 cases, and disagreed in 146. Additionally, they only agreed when the ID was a trn:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

data %>%
  count(tools_agree, id_type_group) %>%
  arrange(desc(tools_agree)) %>%
  kable()
```

## 5) Description of each tool - type of ID and location

### Tool 1: sciscore

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#subset of sciscore_hit = TRUE
sciscore <- subset(data, data$sciscore_hit %in% c("TRUE"))

sciscore %>%
  count(id_type_group, id_type) %>%
  kable()
```

`sciscore` detected 55 trial registry number IDs and 2 protocol IDs. The trn were only from ctgov and eudract registries.

Additionally, `sciscore` detected the IDs in more than 2 locations: abstract (24 cases), methods (55) and other location (8):

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Select only the three columns of interest
location_analysis1 <- sciscore[, c("id_in_abstract", "id_in_methods", 
                                 "id_in_other_location")]

# Count TRUE values for each selected variable
count_true <- colSums(location_analysis1)

#create barplot
barplot(count_true, names.arg = colnames(location_analysis1), 
        col = custom_palette(length(count_true)), 
        main = "Location of IDs detected by sciscore", ylab = "Count",
        ylim = c(0, max(count_true) + 5))

#calculate midpoints of bars
bar_midpoints <- barplot(count_true, plot = FALSE)

#add total count
text(bar_midpoints, count_true, labels = count_true, pos = 3, col = "black", cex = 0.8)
```

Although the majority of IDs were in both methods and another location, there were 2 cases where the IDs were found in the introduction and not in the methods section: `NCT03349060` and `NCT03575871`.

These two IDs were used as a reference in the same paper ([click here to see research article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34406366/)).

### Tool 2: trialidentifier

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#subset of trialidentifier_hit = TRUE
trialidentifier <- subset(data, data$trialidentifier_hit %in% c("TRUE"))

trialidentifier %>%
  count(id_type_group, id_type) %>%
  kable()
```

`trialidentifier` identified 139 trial registry number IDs, 136 from ctgov and 3 from isrctn.

Additionally, `trialidentifier` detected the IDs in more than 2 locations: abstract (35 cases), methods (65) and other location (80):

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Select only the three columns of interest
location_analysis2 <- trialidentifier[, c("id_in_abstract", "id_in_methods", 
                                 "id_in_other_location")]

# Count TRUE values for each selected variable
count_true <- colSums(location_analysis2)

#create barplot
barplot(count_true, names.arg = colnames(location_analysis2), 
        col = custom_palette(length(count_true)), 
        main = "Location of IDs detected by trialidentifier", ylab = "Count",
        ylim = c(0, max(count_true) + 10))

#calculate midpoints of bars
bar_midpoints <- barplot(count_true, plot = FALSE)

#add total count
text(bar_midpoints, count_true, labels = count_true, pos = 3, col = "black", cex = 0.8)
```

### Tool 3: ctregistries

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#subset of ctregistries_hit = TRUE
ctregistries <- subset(data, data$ctregistries_hit %in% c("TRUE"))

ctregistries %>%
  count(id_type_group) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  kable()
```

Out of the 4 tools, `ctregistries` was the one who selected the 29 cases of false positives, and the majority (13 cases) were funding ids:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

ctregistries %>%
  filter(id_type_group == "false_positive") %>%
  count(id_type) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  kable()
```

However, it also detected 166 trial registry number IDs, and the majority (134) were ctgov registry ids:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

ctregistries %>%
  filter(id_type_group == "trn") %>%
  count(id_type) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  kable()
```

Finally, `ctregistries` detected the IDs in more than 2 locations: abstract (43 cases), methods (91), other location (112):

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Select only the three columns of interest
location_analysis3 <- ctregistries[, c("id_in_abstract", "id_in_methods", 
                                 "id_in_other_location")]

# Count TRUE values for each selected variable
count_true <- colSums(location_analysis3)

#create barplot
barplot(count_true, names.arg = colnames(location_analysis3), 
        col = custom_palette(length(count_true)), 
        main = "Location of IDs detected by ctregistries", ylab = "Count",
        ylim = c(0, max(count_true) + 10))

#calculate midpoints of bars
bar_midpoints <- barplot(count_true, plot = FALSE)

#add total count
text(bar_midpoints, count_true, labels = count_true, pos = 3, col = "black", cex = 0.8)
```

### Tool 4: nct

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#subset of nct_hit = TRUE
nct <- subset(data, data$nct_hit %in% c("TRUE"))

nct %>%
  count(id_type_group, id_type) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  kable()
```

`nct` identified 137 trial registry number IDs, all from ctgov.

Additionally, `nct` detected the IDs in more than 2 locations: abstract (34 cases), methods (63), other location (80):

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Select only the three columns of interest
location_analysis4 <- nct[, c("id_in_abstract", "id_in_methods", 
                                 "id_in_other_location")]

# Count TRUE values for each selected variable
count_true <- colSums(location_analysis4)

#create barplot
barplot(count_true, names.arg = colnames(location_analysis4), 
        col = custom_palette(length(count_true)), 
        main = "Location of IDs detected by nct", ylab = "Count",
        ylim = c(0, max(count_true) + 10))

#calculate midpoints of bars
bar_midpoints <- barplot(count_true, plot = FALSE)

#add total count
text(bar_midpoints, count_true, labels = count_true, pos = 3, col = "black", cex = 0.8)
```

### Comparative analysis of the 4 tools

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

data %>%
  filter(id_type_group == "trn") %>% 
  count(ctregistries_hit, sciscore_hit, trialidentifier_hit, nct_hit) %>%
  kable()

```

Based on this table, we can see that:

-   **ctregistries** detected 28 trial registration ids that no other tool found, and only missed 3 ids that were detected by both trialidentifier and nct.

-   **sciscore** detected 54 ids that all the other tools also found, and it found only one extra id that was also detected by ctregistries. Overall the tool missed 114 trial registration ids.

-   **trialidentifier** seem to agree in the majority of cases with nct, but it found 3 additional ids. Overall the tool missed 30 trial registration ids.

-   **nct** found only one additional ids compared to trial identifier. Overall the tool missed 32 trial registration ids.

## 6) False positives overview

As reported before, the 29 false positives were detected by ctregistries. The locations of these false positive were in the methods section (5 cases) and other location (24 cases):

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

false_positive <- data %>%
  filter(id_type_group == "false_positive")

# Select only the three columns of interest
location_analysis5 <- false_positive[, c("id_in_abstract", "id_in_methods", 
                                 "id_in_other_location")]

# Count TRUE values for each selected variable
count_true <- colSums(location_analysis5)

#create barplot
barplot(count_true, names.arg = colnames(location_analysis5), 
        col = custom_palette(length(count_true)), 
        main = "Location of false positives", ylab = "Count",
        ylim = c(0, max(count_true) + 10))

#calculate midpoints of bars
bar_midpoints <- barplot(count_true, plot = FALSE)

#add total count
text(bar_midpoints, count_true, labels = count_true, pos = 3, col = "black", cex = 0.8)

```

Out of the 24 false positives that were found in another location, 13 were found in the acknowledgments section and consisted only of funding IDs, 10 were found in the results section, from which 6 were drug ids and 4 were datapoints. Finally, one false positive was found in the introduction section, and it consisted of a medical acronym.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

false_positive %>%
  filter(!is.na(other_location)) %>%
  group_by(id_type) %>%
  count(other_location) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  kable()
```

## 7) Additional observations

### TRN from the study itself or as a reference to other studies

Some papers analyzed use specifically the ctgov trial registry number as a way to cite other studies in their introduction or discussion. In this analysis, 71 of 137 ctgov trn's were used as reference.

### Funding IDs

Sometimes they were detected as IDs, but not in all cases. For example, funding IDs detected by the tools were 12 digits long:

![](images/Screenshot%202023-12-04%20at%2011.21.58.png){width="350"}

Funding IDs that were present in the negative control check, and therefore not detected by the tools, were slightly shorter (for example: 92035302) or longer (for example: 2016YFD0100800).

### TRN with missing digits

There were two cases of ctgov IDs reported with a missing digit, but the tools `trialidentifier` and `nct` were still able to identify them.

![](images/Screenshot%202023-12-06%20at%2009.28.29.png)

### Negative-control check summary

An additional analysis was conducted on 50 research articles where a hit was not found by any of the tools. These papers were grouped in a dataset called `nc_man_check`, which contained the following variables/columns:

-   **PMCID**: character. PMC identifier of the paper where no registration ID was found.

-   **paper_url**: link to the PubMed website where the paper is available.

-   **reg_id_in_paper**: nominal. `TRUE` if paper contains one or more registration ids, `FALSE` if it does not contain any registration id, and `Unsure` if it contains an suspected registration id.

-   **reg_id**: character. If reg_id_in_paper is TRUE or Unsure, this column registers the id or suspected id.

-   **comments**: character. Brief observation on the flagged id.

Overall, out of the 50 papers reviewed, there where only three papers flagged for a possible registration number:

1.  Number ID found for the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC): `2014092403`. This could be a protocol ID.

2.  Number ID from www.researchregistry.com: `researchregistry7399`

3.  Number ID for Prospero Registry: `CRD42021225699`

There were also Ethical ID numbers present in 7 cases. These types of ID were not detected by the tools, but one could question if those are considered as a form of registration or not.

Finally, as mention before, there were 6 cases of funding IDs that were present on some of these papers. The IDs were different as the ones that were being detected in the main analysis as funding_ids.
