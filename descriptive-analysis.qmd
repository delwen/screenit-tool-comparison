## Introduction

This document presents the descriptive results from the analysis of 4 different tools (`sciscore`, `trialidentifier`, `ctregistries` and `nct`). The aim of these tools is to screen papers for one or more registration IDs (protocol, trial registry, etc).

This analysis was limited to papers (n = 117) where a hit was found by one or more tools. Overall, 200 IDs were analyzed.

#### Main analyses:

1.  Types of ID detected

2.  Where were the IDs located (abstract section, methods section, etc.)?

3.  Were the papers research articles?

4.  Did the tools agree/disagree? (i.e. they all found the ID = agree).

5.  Description of each tool - type of ID and location

6.  Additional observations

## 1) Types of ID detected

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(here)
library(wordcloud)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

#load dataset
data <- read_csv(here("data", "regset.csv"))

#general overview
table(data$id_type_group)
```

The three main groups of ID observed were `trial registration numbers (trn)`, `protocols`, and `false positives`.

### TRNs

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

trn <- subset(data, data$id_type %in% c("ctgov", "umin", "drks", "irct", "chictr", 
                                        "isrctn","ctri", "eudract", "actrn", "jrct", 
                                        "kct", "ntr", "pactr"))

table(trn$id_type)
```

The majority of the trial registry numbers were from the ctgov registry, followed by umin, dkrs and irct.

-   ctgov - US Clinical Trials Register

-   umin - University Hospital Medical Information Network Register

-   drks - German Clinical Trials Register

-   irct - Iranian Registry of Cinical Trials

-   chictr - Chinese Clinical Trial Registry

-   isrctn - ISRCTN Registry

-   actrn - Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry

-   jrct - Japan Registry of Clinical Trials

-   kct - Korean Clinical Trial Registry

### Protocols

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

protocol <- subset(data, data$id_type %in% c("protocols_io"))

table(protocol$id_type)
```

We only had two IDs that were included in links to specific protocols from protocols.io

### False positives

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

false_positive <- subset(data, data$id_type %in% c("catalogue_id", "datapoint", 
                                                   "drug_id", "funding_id", 
                                                   "medical_acronym",
                                                   "medical_device"))

table(false_positive$id_type)
```

The main types of false positives we encounter were IDs corresponding to specific fundings or grants.

## 2) Where were the IDs located?

### General overview

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Select only the three columns of interest
location <- data[, c("id_in_abstract", "id_in_methods", "id_in_other_location")]

# Count TRUE values for each selected variable
count_true <- colSums(location)

#select custom colors
custom_palette <- colorRampPalette(c("#4EA8DE", "#48BFE3", "#56CFE1"))

#create barplot
barplot(count_true, names.arg = colnames(location), 
        col = custom_palette(length(count_true)),
        main = "Location of IDs",
        ylab = "Count", ylim = c(0, max(count_true) + 15))

# Calculate the midpoints of the bars
bar_midpoints <- barplot(count_true, plot = FALSE)

# Add total count labels on each column (centered)
text(bar_midpoints, count_true, labels = count_true, pos = 3, col = "black", cex = 0.8)
```

**What were the other locations?** - discussion (53 cases), introduction (23 cases), acknowledgements (16 cases ), results (11 cases), etc.

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# separating locations where there are more than 1 options
locations <- unlist(strsplit(as.character(data$other_location), ", "))

# Create a data frame with the table of frequencies
other_location <- as.data.frame(table(locations))

wordcloud(words = other_location$locations, 
          freq = other_location$Freq,
          min.freq = 0,
          max.words = 200,
          random.order = FALSE,
          rot.per = 0,
          colors = brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))
```

### NOTE:

The IDs analyzed could be in **one or more locations**, that is why there are more cases out of a total of 200 IDs. This is important to remember for a following section that analyzes the location of the ID by tool.

## 3) Were the papers research articles?

Here we evaluated if the papers had the structure of a research article (abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, etc.).

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

#Group data by PMCID
result <- data %>%
  group_by(PMCID) %>%
  summarise(paper_is_research_article = any(paper_is_research_article))

#Create a table with counts
count_table <- result %>%
  count(paper_is_research_article)
```

![](images/Screenshot%202023-12-06%20at%2010.14.29.png){width="251"}

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
  
#ID count
table(data$paper_is_research_article)
```

Out of 117 papers reviewed, 112 were research articles, and were associated with 159 IDs. The remaining 5 articles in which 41 IDs were found appeared to be either protocol papers, review of findings and an article that did not present a methods section.

It is important to know that 33 out of the 41 IDs came from the same non-research article, which conducted a review and cited studies using their ctgov ID ([click here to see](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35237397/))

## 4) Did the tools agree/disagree?

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

table(data$tools_agree)
```

Overall, the tools agreed in 54 cases, and disagreed in 146. Additionally, they only agreed when the ID was a trn:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
table(data$tools_agree, data$id_type_group)
```

## 5) Description of each tool - type of ID and location

### Tool 1: sciscore

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#subset of sciscore_hit = TRUE
sciscore <- subset(data, data$sciscore_hit %in% c("TRUE"))

table(sciscore$id_type_group)
table(sciscore$id_type)
```

`sciscore` detected 55 trial registry number IDs and 2 protocol IDs. The trn were from ctgov and eudract.

Additionally, `sciscore` detected the IDs in more than 2 locations: abstract (24 cases), methods (55) and other location (9).

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Select only the three columns of interest
location_analysis1 <- sciscore[, c("id_in_abstract", "id_in_methods", 
                                 "id_in_other_location")]

# Count TRUE values for each selected variable
count_true <- colSums(location_analysis1)

#create barplot
barplot(count_true, names.arg = colnames(location_analysis1), 
        col = custom_palette(length(count_true)), 
        main = "Location of IDs detected by sciscore", ylab = "Count",
        ylim = c(0, max(count_true) + 5))

#calculate midpoints of bars
bar_midpoints <- barplot(count_true, plot = FALSE)

#add total count
text(bar_midpoints, count_true, labels = count_true, pos = 3, col = "black", cex = 0.8)
```

Although the majority of IDs were in both methods and another location, there were 2 cases where the IDs were found in the introduction and not in the methods section: `NCT03349060` and `NCT03575871`.

These two IDs were used as a reference in the same paper ([click here to see](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34406366/)).

### Tool 2: trialidentifier

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#subset of trialidentifier_hit = TRUE
trialidentifier <- subset(data, data$trialidentifier_hit %in% c("TRUE"))

table(trialidentifier$id_type_group)
table(trialidentifier$id_type)
```

`trialidentifier` identified 139 trial registry number IDs, from both ctgov and isrctn.

Additionally, `trialidentifier` detected the IDs in more than 2 locations: abstract (35 cases), methods (63) and other location (81).

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Select only the three columns of interest
location_analysis2 <- trialidentifier[, c("id_in_abstract", "id_in_methods", 
                                 "id_in_other_location")]

# Count TRUE values for each selected variable
count_true <- colSums(location_analysis2)

#create barplot
barplot(count_true, names.arg = colnames(location_analysis2), 
        col = custom_palette(length(count_true)), 
        main = "Location of IDs detected by trialidentifier", ylab = "Count",
        ylim = c(0, max(count_true) + 10))

#calculate midpoints of bars
bar_midpoints <- barplot(count_true, plot = FALSE)

#add total count
text(bar_midpoints, count_true, labels = count_true, pos = 3, col = "black", cex = 0.8)
```

### Tool 3: ctregistries

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#subset of ctregistries_hit = TRUE
ctregistries <- subset(data, data$ctregistries_hit %in% c("TRUE"))

table(ctregistries$id_type_group)
```

Out of the 4 tools, `ctregistries` was the one who selected the 29 cases of false positives. However, it also detected 166 trial registry number IDs.

Finally, `ctregistries` detected the IDs in more than 2 locations: abstract (43 cases), methods (89), other location (113).

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Select only the three columns of interest
location_analysis3 <- ctregistries[, c("id_in_abstract", "id_in_methods", 
                                 "id_in_other_location")]

# Count TRUE values for each selected variable
count_true <- colSums(location_analysis3)

#create barplot
barplot(count_true, names.arg = colnames(location_analysis3), 
        col = custom_palette(length(count_true)), 
        main = "Location of IDs detected by ctregistries", ylab = "Count",
        ylim = c(0, max(count_true) + 10))

#calculate midpoints of bars
bar_midpoints <- barplot(count_true, plot = FALSE)

#add total count
text(bar_midpoints, count_true, labels = count_true, pos = 3, col = "black", cex = 0.8)
```

### Tool 4: nct

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#subset of nct_hit = TRUE
nct <- subset(data, data$nct_hit %in% c("TRUE"))

table(nct$id_type_group)
table(nct$id_type)
```

`nct` identified 137 trial registry number IDs, all from ctgov.

Additionally, `nct` detected the IDs in more than 3 locations: abstract (34 cases), methods (61), other location (81).

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Select only the three columns of interest
location_analysis4 <- nct[, c("id_in_abstract", "id_in_methods", 
                                 "id_in_other_location")]

# Count TRUE values for each selected variable
count_true <- colSums(location_analysis4)

#create barplot
barplot(count_true, names.arg = colnames(location_analysis4), 
        col = custom_palette(length(count_true)), 
        main = "Location of IDs detected by nct", ylab = "Count",
        ylim = c(0, max(count_true) + 10))

#calculate midpoints of bars
bar_midpoints <- barplot(count_true, plot = FALSE)

#add total count
text(bar_midpoints, count_true, labels = count_true, pos = 3, col = "black", cex = 0.8)
```

## 6) Additional observations

### TRN from the study itself or as a reference to other studies

Some papers analyzed use specifically the ctgov trial registry number as a way to cite other studies in their introduction or discussion. In this analysis, 71 of 137 ctgov trn's were used as reference.

### Funding IDs

Sometimes they were detected as IDs, but not in all cases. For example, funding IDs detected by the tools were 12 digits long:

![](images/Screenshot%202023-12-04%20at%2011.21.58.png){width="350"}

Funding IDs that were present in the negative control check, and therefore not detected by the tools, were slightly shorter (for example: 92035302) or longer (for example: 2016YFD0100800).

### TRN with missing digits

There were two cases of ctgov IDs reported with a missing digit, but the tools `trialidentifier` and `nct` were still able to identify them.

![](images/Screenshot%202023-12-06%20at%2009.28.29.png)

### Negative-control check summary

Overall, out of the 50 papers reviewed, there where only three papers flagged for a possible registration number:

1.  Number ID found for the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC): `2014092403`. This could be a protocol ID.

2.  Number ID from www.researchregistry.com: `researchregistry7399`

3.  Number ID for Prospero Registry: `CRD42021225699`

There were also Ethical ID numbers present in 7 cases. These types of ID were not detected by the tools, but one could question if those are considered as a form of registration or not.

Finally, as mention before, there were 6 cases of funding IDs that were present on some of these papers. The IDs were different as the ones that were being detected in the main analysis as funding_ids.
